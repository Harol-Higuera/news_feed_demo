### TODO
1. I want to reload the tabs only once. The state is persisted but the tabs reload every time I switch between them. I'm missing something.
2. Why is the API called multiple times when switching tabs? I want to fix it.
3. Add the apiKey in an Http Interpector.
4. Make this app Unit testable
5. Define the routes in a file or something. Also including parameters.
6. Split the composables inside a NavGraphBuilder. In real apps this could have too many composables and it would look messy. Perhaps in extensions of NavGraphBuilder.
7. When open Detail Screen, I want to make it a modal view that cover the entire screen.
8. Organize the Themes in a better way. Add some more functionalities to make the theme settings more obvious.
